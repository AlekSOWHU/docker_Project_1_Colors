# Docker Color App

This project is a Python Flask application running in a Docker container. It allows users to click colors on a webpage and saves the count to a Redis database.

It demonstrates key DevOps concepts:
- **Docker Compose:** Running multiple containers together.
- **Persistence:** Saving data so it isn't lost when the container stops.
- **Networking:** Connecting the Python app to the Redis database.
